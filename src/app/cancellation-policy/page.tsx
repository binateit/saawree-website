              There may be certain orders that we are unable to accept and must
              cancel. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to refuse or
              cancel any order for any reason. Some situations that may result
              in your order being cancelled include limitations on quantities
              available for purchase, inaccuracies or errors in product or
              pricing information, or problems identified by our credit and
              fraud avoidance department.

              of the order placed by you, however, we may charge your card
              (capture) only with the amount corresponding to the actual portion
              of the order that we are able/willing to fulfill, and any
              associated shipping charges/taxes and levies etc.{" "}

              not captured by us in the time period stipulated by our Merchant
              Banker, will not be captured/charged. If however the same is
              charged to your card/bank account in error, we will refund it as
              soon as the same is realized by us or brought to our notice,
